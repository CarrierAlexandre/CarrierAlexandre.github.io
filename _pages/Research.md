Job market paper: 

*  **Assessing the aggregate and distributional implications of large-scale bond purchases in the euro area** (draft available upon request) 

<p style="text-align: justify">
Abstract: This paper studies how central bank large-scale bond purchases (namely \textit{Quantitative Easing}) affected euro area economic activity and income inequality, within a New Keynesian model with limited asset market participation. I estimate the model using Bayesian methods, considering the occasionally binding constraint on the policy rate and the \textit{public sector purchase programme} (PSPP) implemented by the ECB in 2015. The results suggest that the PSPP has effectively affected both output and inflation. On income inequality, the impact was modest on average. However, it was non-linear, income inequality increased during the early stages of the program due to asset price effects. In contrast, the medium-term impact on income inequality was characterized by growth in labor income, which became the main driver. These results show that the distributional impact of QE is time-varying, due to differences in the responsiveness of income components.
