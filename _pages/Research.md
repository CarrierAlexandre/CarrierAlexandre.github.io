##### Assessing the aggregate and distributional implications of large-scale bond purchases in the euro area #####

[Latest available draft here](https://carrieralexandre.github.io/assets/Carrier_JMP_October_2023.pdf) 

<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="3"> Abstract: This paper studies how central bank large-scale bond purchases (namely Quantitative Easing) affected euro area economic activity and income inequality, within a New Keynesian model with limited asset market participation. I estimate the model using Bayesian methods, considering the occasionally binding constraint on the policy rate and the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) implemented by the ECB in 2015. The results suggest that the PSPP has effectively affected both output and inflation. On income inequality, the impact was modest on average. However, it was non-linear, income inequality increased during the early stages of the program due to asset price effects. In contrast, the medium-term impact on income inequality was characterized by growth in labor income, which became the main driver. These results show that the distributional impact of QE is time-varying, due to differences in the responsiveness of income components. </font>

<font size="3"> Abstract: This paper studies the effects of central banks' asset purchases on long-term government bond yields, in a model featuring investors who adopt a simple yet optimal AR(1) forecasting rule based on past data. By examining the convergence dynamics of agents towards a specific Behavioral Learning Equilibrium (BLE),  we uncover the factors that shape the efficacy of these policies:  financial market volatility and short-term interest rates. In periods characterised by low financial stress, agents' learning process leads to stable convergence, with forecasts exhibiting a near-unit root first-order autocorrelation coefficient. As a consequence, quantitative easing (QE) demonstrates significant and persistent effects on bond yields. However, in times of heightened financial volatility, multiple equilibria emerge, leading QE to have effects that vary from high to low persistence. </font>

##### Optimal normalization policy under behavioral expectations #####

<font size="3"> Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the optimal strategy for a central bank's normalization policy in response to a persistent inflationary shock within a model in which agents' expectations can become de-anchored. We show analytically that, when designing optimal policy, the trade-off changes when expectations are de-anchored and is more costly for economic activity. We characterize optimal policy rules using sufficient statistics, which map the causal effects of policy instruments on each target of the policymaker. Through the use of simulations, we derive optimal interest rates and Quantitative Tightening (QT henceforth) trajectories. We find that QT is less effective than the policy rate to stabilize inflation, and more costly for the output gap. When jointly determining interest rates and QT, we demonstrate that expectations have a limited impact on QT trajectories but a more significant influence on interest rates. </font>
