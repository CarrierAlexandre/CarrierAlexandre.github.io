*  **The effects of large-scale asset purchases on household inequality** (draft available upon request) 

<p style="text-align: justify">
Abstract: This paper studies how central bank asset purchases (namely Quantitative Easing) affected euro area economic activity and income inequality, within a New-Keynesian model with limited asset market participation. I estimate the model using Bayesian methods, considering the occasionally binding constraint on the policy rate and the Quantitative Easing (QE) policy implemented by the ECB during the 2015-2018 period. The results suggest that QE has effectively affected both output and inflation. On income inequality, the impact was modest on average. However, it was non-linear, income inequality increased during the early stages of the programme due to asset price effects. In contrast, the medium-term impact on income inequality was characterized by growth in labour income, which became the main driver. These results show that the distributional impact of QE is time-varying, due to differences in the responsiveness of income components.
