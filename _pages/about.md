I am PhD candidate in Economics at Bielefeld University and the University of Amsterdam.  My research interests are in monetary economics and behavioral macroeconomics.

Currently, I am also a Research Analyst at [De Nederlandsche Bank](https://www.dnb.nl/en/), working on the development of a Suite of Models for policy analysis, under the supervision of [Guido Ascari](https://sites.google.com/site/guidoascari/home?authuser=0).

Last year, I was Ph.D. trainee at the Directorate General Monetary Policy of the European Central Bank, within senior management.
