Some news: I recently joined the DG Monetary Policy of the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) as Economist Graduate Programme Participant.

I recently defended my PhD at the University of Amsterdam and Bielefeld University.

Last year, I was a Research Analyst at [De Nederlandsche Bank](https://www.dnb.nl/en/), working on the development of a Suite of Models for policy analysis, within the team of [Guido Ascari](https://sites.google.com/site/guidoascari/home?authuser=0).

My research is driven towards characterizing, quantifying, and, ultimately, predicting natural phenomena by way of mathematical modelling.
Within this purview, numerical methods are indispensable.
Indeed, they <em>must</em> be used in order to make informed decisions and reach reliable conclusions when facing contemporary problems in science and engineering.
By employing mathematical tools from functional analysis, topology, differential geometry, and numerical linear algebra, the intent of my research is to develop the most accurate and practical numerical methods for modern scientific and engineering purposes.
