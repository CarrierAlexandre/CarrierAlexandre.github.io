I am PhD candidate in Economics at Bielefeld University and the University of Amsterdam. 

Currently, I am also a Research Analyst at De Nederlandsche Bank, working on the development of a Suite of Models for policy analysis, under the supervision of Guido Ascari.

Last year, I was Ph.D. trainee at the Directorate General Monetary Policy of the European Central Bank, within senior management.

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify">
My research is driven towards characterizing, quantifying, and, ultimately, predicting natural phenomena by way of mathematical modelling.
Within this purview, numerical methods are indispensable.
Indeed, they <em>must</em> be used in order to make informed decisions and reach reliable conclusions when facing contemporary problems in science and engineering.
By employing mathematical tools from functional analysis, topology, differential geometry, and numerical linear algebra, the intent of my research is to develop the most accurate and practical numerical methods for modern scientific and engineering purposes.

- Macroeconomics and monetary economics
- Heterogeneous agents
- Bounded rationality and learning
- Computational economics
