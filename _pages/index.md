Welcome to my webpage!

I currently work in the DG Monetary Policy of the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) as Economist Graduate Programme Participant.

I obtained my PhD from the University of Amsterdam and Bielefeld University.

Prior to that, I was a Research Analyst at [De Nederlandsche Bank](https://www.dnb.nl/en/), working on the development of a Suite of Models for policy analysis, within the team of [Guido Ascari](https://sites.google.com/site/guidoascari/home?authuser=0).
