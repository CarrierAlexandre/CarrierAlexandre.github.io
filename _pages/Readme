To better organize all of your pages you can centralize them into a single location similar to posts and collections.

1: Start by placing pages (.md or .html files) into a _pages directory. Meaningfully naming files should be the goal. 

2:  Include pages to be sure Jekyll “sees” and processes the files inside of _pages. Add include: ["_pages"] to _config.yml.

3: Assign permalink overrides in the YAML Front Matter of each.
